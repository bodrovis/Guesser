# Guesser

A dead simple game for 1 or more players made for demonstration purposes. The computer "thinks of" a number and
you're trying to guess it.
A player who first guessed 3 times (adjustable) is considered a winner; his statistics is printed to a `txt` file.

For nix systems use

```
bin/guesser
```

to launch the game. For Windows use

```
bin/guesser.bat
```
